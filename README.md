# AWS-Labs
AWS Labs practice under Prof. Joshua Edgar

Lab 1: Using S3

What you’ll achieve:

Deploy a VPC

Deploy an EC2 with CentOS Linux

Install a simple Apache Web server

Create an S3 bucket, place files in it, and set permissions

Create a simple Web page to link to your file’s URL



Lab 2: Practicing Auto Scaling

What you’ll achieve:

Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the EC2 instance you deployed in Lab #1

Create a Launch Configuration from this AMI

Configure an Auto Scaling Group from your Launch Configuration, to automatically deploy additional instances when the CloudWatch Alarm is triggered

Create said CloudWatch Alarms that monitor instance CPU utilization

Use a stress-testing tool to create fake load and force an Auto Scaling event

Terminate resources from both Lab #1 and #2 to prevent your credit card from being charged
